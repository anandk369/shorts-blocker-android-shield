## No Collection of Personal Information

**We do not collect any personal information.** YouTube Shorts Blocker operates entirely on your device and does not transmit any data to external servers.

## Information Access

Our app requires the following permissions:

- Access any personal information

## How We Use Information

The app uses the Accessibility Service to:

2. Determine when to display the blocking overlay
3. Determine when to remove the overlay

This processing happens entirely on your device.

## Data Storage

YouTube Shorts Blocker does not:
- Create user accounts
